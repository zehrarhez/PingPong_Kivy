# PingPong_Kivy
A ping pong game on desktop which is created by using Python-Kivy.

I used kivy for the first time and made this basic game by using it. 
The main.py provides the movement, velocity, multiplayer status and hitting the wall properties of the ball.
The pong.kv provides the design of the playground and components.
